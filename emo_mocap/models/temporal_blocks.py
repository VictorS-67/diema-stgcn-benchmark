    """
    Basic Temporal Convolutional Network Unit for skeleton-based action recognition.
    https://github.com/yysijie/st-gcn/

    This module performs temporal convolution on motion capture sequences to aggregate
    information from neighboring frames. Unlike spatial graph convolution that operates
    on joint relationships within a frame, this unit captures temporal dependencies
    by convolving across the time dimension.

    Architecture:
        The unit applies a 1D temporal convolution (implemented as 2D with kernel_size=(Kt, 1))
        across the time dimension while preserving spatial relationships. Each joint's
        features are aggregated with its temporal neighbors (past and future frames).

    From STGCN paper:
        "For the temporal dimension, since the number of neighbors for each vertex is
        fixed as 2 (corresponding joints in the previous and following frames), it is
        straightforward to perform the graph convolution similar to the classical
        convolution operation."

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of input feature channels.
        out_channels (int): Number of output feature channels.
        kernel_size (int): Temporal kernel size (number of frames to aggregate).
            Default: 9 (captures 4 past + current + 4 future frames).
        stride (int): Temporal stride for downsampling along time dimension.
            Default: 1 (no temporal downsampling).
        dilation (int): Temporal dilation for expanding receptive field.
            Default: 1 (no dilation).

    Input:
        x (torch.Tensor): Input feature tensor of shape (N, C, T, V) where:
            - N: batch size
            - C: number of input channels
            - T: number of temporal frames
            - V: number of joints/vertices

    Output:
        torch.Tensor: Output feature tensor of shape (N, out_channels, T', V) where:
            - T' depends on stride (T' = T when stride=1)

    Note:
        - Padding is automatically calculated to maintain temporal dimension when stride=1
        - Convolution operates only along time dimension (kernel_size=(Kt, 1))
        - Batch normalization and ReLU activation are applied after convolution
        - Weight initialization is performed using conv_init()

    Example:
        ```python
        # Create temporal unit for 64->128 channel transformation
        tcn_unit = Basic_TCN_Unit(
            in_channels=64,

class TCN_Unit_plus(nn.Module):
    """
    Multi-branch Temporal Convolutional Network Unit from STGCN++ (PySKL).

    This advanced temporal unit implements an Inception-style multi-branch architecture
    that captures temporal dependencies at multiple scales simultaneously. Instead of
    using a single temporal convolution, it splits the computation across six parallel
    branches, each capturing different temporal patterns and receptive fields.

    Architecture:
        The unit consists of six parallel branches:
        1. One 1x1 convolution branch (direct feature transformation)
        2. One max-pooling branch (temporal downsampling with feature extraction)
        3. Four temporal convolution branches with kernel size 3 and dilations 1-4
           (multi-scale temporal feature extraction)

        Each branch processes a portion of the input channels, and their outputs are
        concatenated and refined through a final 1x1 convolution.

    From PySKL paper:
        "The adopted multi-branch TCN consists of six branches: a '1x1' Conv branch,
        a Max-Pooling branch, and four temporal 1D Conv branches with kernel size 3
        and dilations from 1 to 4. It first transforms features with '1x1' Conv and
        divides them into six groups with equal channel width. Then, each feature
        group is processed with a single branch. The six outputs are concatenated
        together and processed by another '1x1' Conv to form the output of the
        multi-branch TCN."

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of input feature channels.
        out_channels (int): Number of output feature channels.
        dropout (float): Dropout probability for regularization. Default: 0.0.
        stride (int): Temporal stride for downsampling along time dimension.
            Default: 1 (no temporal downsampling).

    Input:
        x (torch.Tensor): Input feature tensor of shape (N, C, T, V) where:
            - N: batch size
            - C: number of input channels (must equal in_channels)
            - T: number of temporal frames
            - V: number of joints/vertices

    Output:
        torch.Tensor: Output feature tensor of shape (N, out_channels, T', V) where:
            - T' depends on stride (T' = T when stride=1)

    Channel Distribution:
        - Branch 0: rem_mid_channels = out_channels - mid_channels * 5
        - Branches 1-5: mid_channels = out_channels // 6
        - Total output channels = rem_mid_channels + 5 * mid_channels = out_channels

    Branch Configuration:
        - Branch 0: 3x1 conv with dilation=1 (local temporal patterns)
        - Branch 1: 3x1 conv with dilation=2 (medium-range temporal patterns)
        - Branch 2: 3x1 conv with dilation=3 (longer-range temporal patterns)
        - Branch 3: 3x1 conv with dilation=4 (long-range temporal patterns)
        - Branch 4: Max pooling with kernel=3 (temporal downsampling)
        - Branch 5: 1x1 conv (channel transformation only)

    Advantages:
        - Captures multi-scale temporal dependencies simultaneously
        - More computationally efficient than single large kernel
        - Better gradient flow through multiple parallel paths
        - Increased model capacity with controlled parameter growth

    Example:
        ```python
        # Create multi-branch temporal unit
        tcn_plus = TCN_Unit_plus(
            in_channels=64,
            out_channels=128,
            dropout=0.1,
            stride=1
        )

        # Input: batch_size=32, channels=64, frames=100, joints=25
        x = torch.randn(32, 64, 100, 25)
        output = tcn_plus(x)  # Shape: (32, 128, 100, 25)
        ```

    Note:
        - Each branch processes the full input but outputs different channel counts
        - Batch normalization and ReLU are applied within each branch
        - Final transformation includes additional batch norm and dropout
        - More suitable for complex temporal patterns than Basic_TCN_Unit
